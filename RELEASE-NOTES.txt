Date: 05/24/2017
----------------------------------
Changes/New Features:

* Message Stream Encryption
* Added API for retrieving the full list of registered torrents

Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* Last block in a chunk is incorrectly marked as complete even when partially written

----------------------------------
Release: 1.1
Date: 04/10/2017
----------------------------------
Changes/New Features:

* Support for auto-loading modules from the classpath
* Enhanced API for building standalone and shared-runtime clients
* Streaming (continuous) piece selectors
* Improvements in piece selection and peer assignments algorithm
* Support for multi-threaded hashing (verification) of torrent data on startup
* Lifecycle binding API improvements; support for asynchronous bindings
* Tools for creating custom protocol tests

Bug Fixes/Improvements:

* Torrent processing should not terminate when interaction with the tracker failed
* Announce key can be missing in trackerless torrents
* Failures on receiving unexpected blocks should be optional
* Peer connection occasionally stopped receiving/sending data due to a buffer compaction bug
* Verification tasks should be submitted only for complete pieces
* Chunk descriptor overlapping two files contained no blocks when the latter file was smaller than the leftovers from the former file
* Calculate total size for multi-file torrents
* NPE on UDP message worker shutdown
* Multi-tracker does not announce to next trackers in tier if an exception was thrown
* Querying trackers and other peer sources should be async
* Adaptive message processing interval in message dispatcher to reduce the CPU load
* Speed-up the initial startup by skipping verification if a storage unit is empty and by feeding larger blocks to the digester
